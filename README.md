# Report card system

Simple Program designed to store students and grades of students in a CSV

```cpp
class CStudent {

	public:
		std::string m_number;
		float m_lab;
		float m_quiz;
		float m_midTerm;
		float m_final;
		float m_grade;

		void print();


};
```

Current implementation of grades that may be tracked.

Test changes lol
